# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

# The days of the week are the variable for days but it is looked at as one variable
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# The months are the variables for months and the use of \n will put a return
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# This line will display the copy and pull the variables for days
puts "Here are the days: ", days
# This line will display the copy and pull the variables for months
puts "Here are the months: ", months

# The use of PARAGRAPH let's the copy display exactly like it's written
puts <<PARAGRAPH
There's something going on here.
With the PARAGRAPH thing
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want or 5, or 6.
PARAGRAPH
